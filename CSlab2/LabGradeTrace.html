<b>Answers to  Question 1:</b>
<p>
The values  of the variables after being read in are:
<pre>
    preLabPts = 17        preLabMax = 20      labPts = 23    labMax = 25
    postLabPts = 12       postLabMax = 15
</pre>
<ol type=a>
<li>Execution of
<pre>
outClassAvg = preLabPts + postLabPts / preLabMax + postLabMax * 100;

</pre>
Multiplication and division have highest precedence and are evaluated
left to right so the division is the first operation performed.  The
variables postLabPts and preLabMax are both integers so integer division
would be used. Hence the first calculation is
<pre>
           12 / 20  which equals 0
</pre>
The next operation is the multiplication:  postLabMax * 100 = 1500
<p>
Finally, the two additions are performed left to right:
<pre>
          17 + 0 + 1500 = 1517
</pre>
<li>Execution of 
<pre>
      inClassAvg = labPts / labMax * 100;
</pre>
Division and multiplication have the same precedence so evaluation is
left to  right.  All operands are integers so integer division is used.
Hence the evaluation is as follows:
<pre>
      inClassAvg = (23 / 25) * 100 = 0 * 100 = 0
</pre>
<li>Execution of
<pre>
      labGrade = OUT_WEIGHT * outClassAvg + IN_WEIGHT * inClassAvg;
</pre>
is as follows:
<pre> 
      labGrade = (0.4 * 1517) + (0.6 * 0) = 606 + 0 = 606.8
</pre>
</ol>
