<h2 align=center>Solution to <i>Two Meanings of Plus</i></h2>
<p>
<b>Question 1, part (c)</b>
<p>
The <b>first</b> print statement:  System.out.println ("8 plus 5 is " + 8 + 5);
prints
<pre>
        8 plus 5 is 85
</pre>
Because: There are no parentheses so evaluation is from left to 
right. The first plus has a string operand on the left so the
operation is concatenation - the 8 is concatenated with the string
and the result is a string.  Now the second plus has a string
on the left so it too is evaluated as concatenation - the 5
is concatenated with the string "8 plus 5 is 8"
<p>
The <b>second</b> print statement: 
	System.out.println ("8 plus 5 is " + (8 + 5));

prints
<pre>
        8 plus 5 is 13
</pre>
Because:  The expression 8 + 5 in parentheses is evaluated first
and both operands are numeric so the numbers are added to get 13.
Then the other + is concatenation since the operand on the left
is a string - the 13 is concatenated with that string.
<p>
The <b>third</b> print statement: 
	System.out.println (8 + 5 + " equals 8 plus 5.");

prints
<pre>
        13 equals 8 plus 5.
</pre>
Because: The expression is evaluated left to right since there
are no parentheses.  The leftmost + has two numeric operands so
they are added to get 13. Then the second + has one string
operand so the 13 and that string are concatenated.

<b>Question 1, part (d):</b>  A space should be put inside the quotation marks
after the word about and another one before the word years.
